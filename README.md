# TVC Rocket Design in Matlab Simulink 

## Rocket Specifications

Mass = 0.543kg, COM String = 0.3m, String Length = 0.65m, COM-TVC = 0.28m, Time per oscillation peak = 1.6s

Mass Moment Inertia: (Mass of Rocket x g x (Time per oscillation peak)^2 x (Distance between COM & Strings)^2)  / (4 x pi^2 x (String length from hinge to rocket holder)) = 0.048
